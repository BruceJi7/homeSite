But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. 

Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. 

You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.
