Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that to which you are averse. 

However, he who fails to obtain the object of his desire is disappointed, and he who incurs the object of his aversion wretched. 

If, then, you confine your aversion to those objects only which are contrary to the natural use of your faculties, which you have in your own control, you will never incur anything to which you are averse.
