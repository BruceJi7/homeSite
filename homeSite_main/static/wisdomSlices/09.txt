The will of nature may be learned from those things in which we don't distinguish from each other. 
For example, when our neighbor's boy breaks a cup, or the like, we are presently ready to say, "These things will happen." 
Be assured, then, that when your own cup likewise is broken, you ought to be affected just as when another's cup was broken.
