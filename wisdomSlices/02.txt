Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, 

"You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be." 

And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, by this: 

whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not; 
and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.
